## Description
*What does $4.99 get you these days?! One crowbar?! Two swordfish?! Three airliners?! Four Sci-Fi doors?! A super store?! The Taj Mahal?! The Sahara desert?! A seagull?! Come and see!*

*v r $4.99* is an exhibition of 3D assets purchased on the Unity Asset Store for US$4.99. The asset store has 46 unique categories of 3D assets, from the baseline 3D category, through to humanoids, dungeon environments, and vegetation. *v r $4.99* contains two examples of each categories, positioned in the Sahara desert (yes, that's an asset that costs $4.99 as well), as an eclectic Noah's Ark of the kinds of things we can see in videogames. You're invited to take a walk around and consider the items on show, maybe ask some questions. Why is an "old mattress" the same price as a complete office interior? Do you prefer realism or low poly? What kind of game would you make with that UFO? What about those "horror trees"? Come one, come all!

*v r $4.99* was created in [Unity](https://unity.com/) and involves heavy use of the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) for obvious reasons. See the game itself for a full listing of assets used, there are informational plinths everywhere. The character controller in the game is [Gold Player](https://github.com/Hertzole/gold-player) by hertzole.
