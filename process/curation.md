# Curation

## Introduction

This is going to be (in theory) a document where I'll write about curation strategies and so on - is that even a term? Anyway, I want to examine the set of potential assets and take notes about interesting works/assets and why they're interesting. I want to think about the curation heuristics and why I would choose one thing and not another. And I want to think about the actual exhibition staging and where I should put things and why I should put them there. And I want to think about any kind of information design that may well prove necessary.

I don't want this to function as a diary, I want it to be a practical document that gathers my thoughts together, okay? Got it, buster?

## Asset review v.2 (see end for v.1)

Now that I've decided on Unity's category system I'm going to profile the categories with the aim of choosing two assets from each "leaf". Before I begin, let me look at the availability in the categories, though, and any issues around being forced to buy assets that just won't work together. So, observations...

* Insects (6) and Armor (9) are the smallest categories, but that should still be enough to work with
* The environments worry me the most, but I can see from Dungeons as an example that they contain plenty of things that aren't giant landscapes that would be hard tow ork with
* Environments are often "packs" which should be fine too - can show their sample scene or just the modular pieces

Hmmm, in short I think this is going to be fine, so let's start some reviews and choosings.

### 3D

The horror. The overall category has 6019 in it, of which 5734 are covered by subcateogories. Meaning there are an elusive 285 elements in there that aren't represented in any subcategory and that I therefore have never seen. They're going to almost all be miscategorizations, but to be true to this new methodology (unless I just go with dendrites) I need to pick two of the 285 that are ideally sort of "just 3D" and nothing else. FUCK.

Honestly if I can just find two usable things I may cave because this seems like a fucking nightmare.

* Mannequin
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/female-mannequin-humanoid-rig-87977
* Cells are pretty cool
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/biology-cells-pack-97118
* A bucket
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/bucket-wood-pbr-4k-56905
* Film camera
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/classic-film-camera-58100
* Trophies! That's nice
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/low-poly-trophy-pack-75261
* Arrows pack is fun...
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/arrows-pack-66609
* Roadside signs!!!
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/customizable-roadside-marquee-sign-100458

Okay I could be happy with Cells and Roadside signs for sure. Both pretty fun and weird. Yeah okay that's nice I think. Done.

### 3D > Animations

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/zombie-starter-mocap-animation-pack-61492#content
  * Weird trying to distinguish this from other sets of models but these ARE nice animations and it's interesting to draw attention to that with the informational plinth?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/personality-animations-pack-161134
  * Quite like how utterly basic the base model is here
  * And the idea of a "confident" walk is neat
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/9t5-gesture-animations-164906
  * Something a bit mesmerizing about this one too though... hand gestures are interesting

### 3D > Characters

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/cartoon-chef-149364
  * There's something definitely funny about the cartoon chef and his flip
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/pbr-mechanical-robot-character-vol-02-106195
  * Pretty cool robot... belongs in robots obviously, but here it is
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/3d-creature-stump-pack-55399
  * Definitely something funny about a stump pack
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/super-low-poly-dudes-6619
  * Super low poly dudes
  * And they dance! Though that may just be mixamo
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/anime-character-code-lanky-contain-vrm-183464
  * I really like lanky!
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/prisoner-02-107465
  * OH MAN. Prisoner two.
  * There's also prisoner one. It would be quite funny to buy both separately and have them separate to point out some interesting pricing things people do?

I'm kind of sold on the prisoner option.

### 3D > Characters > Animals

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animal-pack-deluxe-v2-144071
  * Hard to go past an animal pack deluxe you know
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/low-poly-rigged-animals-123656
  * Another pack but low poly, nice comparison? Even down to the "which animals" thing?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/trilobite-61308
  * A trilobyte! By Junnichi Suko though

I think the two packs here are pretty fine

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Birds

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fbirds&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fbirds&price=4-4&orderBy=1
  * A chicken - notably it's "recommended by our users" in the UI, which is no doubt some bullshit marketing, but if ever category happened to have this I could potentially always/usually priortize it?
  * Is animated etc., will have to think about how to display animations (loop them all, just show the most appropriate one like idling?)
* OMABU has created some really charming low poly animals, should include one somewhere (but probably only one to avoid repeating creators)
* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/cartoon-owl-forest-environment-67572
  * Quite like this one because of the environment - the idea you would buy not just the owl but the place the owl is sitting
* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/seagull-larus-canus-109558
  * A seagull that's fairly realistic is intriguing, the idea it could kind of walk around in the space near the plinth would be neat?

I'm leaning cartoon owl and seagull.

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Fish

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Ffish&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* Junnichi Suko makes some pretty nice realistic fish
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/fish/swordfish-pbr-174772
  * A fancy swordfish too...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/fish/low-poly-fish-pack-1-177981
  * A low poly fish pack, nice to pair with a realistic fish?

So leaning toward the pack and then one of the realistic fish... something about the Suko stuff is appealing... a craftsperson of fish...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Insects

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Finsects&price=4-4&orderBy=1

There are only 6!

* Oh but the butterflies are there yesssssss! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/insects/73-animated-butterflies-164871
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/insects/egypt-pack-spider-122734
  * Is it cultural "appropriation" to have something like this as an Egypt Pack?
  * It's quite a useful one because it has such heavy game implications - like these are enemies in variations that you would fight...

Pending Egypt I guess the two I cite there are my favs...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Mammals

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fmammals&price=4-4&orderBy=1

Massive category.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/cu-cat-10767#content
  * Cu Cat is funny and Recommended By Our Users.
  * I like the idea of internet cuteness within this world of games, implies another kind of Nintendogs sort of game
* OMABU and Suko are both represented heavily here again
* There's also a Cu Puppy if you like dogs - maybe that's fun as a more direct Nintendogs ref?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/whale-simple-3d-model-59288
  * Hard to go past a whale... makes me think of THHGTTG

Huh - the selection here is actually a bit small because it's so dominated by OMABU... this may be the section I take an OMABU for that reason? So probably an OMABU and the Cu Puppies...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Reptiles

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Freptiles&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/allosaurus-and-skeleton-37858
  * Recommended
  * A dinosaur is always good right?
  * This is Suko though so have to be careful
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/t-rex-model-49824
  * A T-Rex...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/japanese-tree-frog-187864
  * Nice little Japanese Tree Frog... quite like the understated nature of it...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/raptor-dinosaur-83903
  * This raptor is pretty nice though... very nicely animated...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/tyrannosaurus-rex-dinosaur-32643
  * More T-Rexes...
* Lizards in Leotards is a key creator here

Possible getting two dinosaurs is a way to go, compare the T-Rexes? Alternatively a big and small, with the tree frog and one of the dinos. The raptors are nice too. Some good range of choices available.

### 3D > Characters > Creatures

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fcreatures&price=4-4&orderBy=1

No subcategories for this one, just 259 sweet, sweet creatures. Of which I guess I'm just picking two. I suddenly wonder whether I could pick representative samples instead, but that's just getting confusing.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/dark-dragon-123448
  * The Recommended one is a Dark Dragon
  * Kind of similar to a dinosaur of course
  * It's nice enough?
* There are some fucked up looking packs from Maksim Bugrimov (who made my statues) that make me kind of want to replace the statues...
  * Oh fuck the video for this one is good https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/humanoid-creatures-pack-162689
  * Like an unintentional parody of the Moulin Rouge or something
  * I may need this
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/rpg-ogre-pack-pbr-mobile-159080
  * Nice ogre
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/mythological-creatures-pack-norse-173135
  * These are quite interesting creatures - amazing scale variation within the pack...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/reaper-boss-pbr-113262
  * There's quite a lot of really intense kind of Dark Souls stuff around

So I guess I'd lean toward Maksim's dancing cabaret and the Norse Mythological creatures for the scale?

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids&price=4-4&orderBy=1&rows=96

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/male-hair-expansion-pack-cute-series-179582
  * That's a lot of hair my friend... I like that...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/man-wearing-suit-129895
  * I do like a man in a suit
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fps-hand-jacket-84616
  * Just some arms and hands, yes please
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/casually-dressed-man-129831
  * Ah yes, the casually dressed man. I love you.

Some good choices in here... probably casually dressed man and the FPS hands? Or the hair? Hmm.

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Fantasy

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids%2Ffantasy&price=4-4&orderBy=1

Feels kind of similar to the previous set... they were pretty humanoid, but whatever?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/evil-fire-demon-122741
  * Recommended
  * More cute than interesting though?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/voxel-fantasy-characters-pack-92617
  * A chance to include some voxels
  * 60+ characters is intriguing
* Most of these are kind of characters in the sense of a human style enemy, they're quite boring
* The female characters are pretty embarrassing
* Lots of repeated companies/creators in this set...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/medieval-fantasy-ice-king-171297#content
  * Something like this maybe? Struggling with this...

So yes to the voxels and then unsure on a second one to be honest.

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Humans

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids%2Fhumans&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/liam-lowpoly-character-100007
  * Liam
  * The Recommended one
  * I like this idea of characters with names, who are already sort of people?
  * Almost like hiring an actor
  * This is by AKISHAQS which made various other things so would need to look out for overlap
  * They also have other similar ideas, e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/kira-lowpoly-character-100303
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/adam-stylized-lowpoly-male-character-181863
  * YESSSSSS. Adam. Lumberjacky sexy men.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/firefighter-in-aluminized-flame-proof-suit-185041
  * This is quite beautiful thanks to the suit...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/sport-woman-city-people-184765
  * Sport Woman City People is pretty funny
  * There's something funny about this one
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/asobi-chan-ver-shinobi-108111
  * Definitely something to the anime thing

Leaning silver custome and the lumberjacks

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Sci-Fi

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/robot-sci-fi-pbr-194064
  * Pretty fancy robot person
  * Maybe bordering into sexism? Hard to say
  * Controversy in the reviews! A claim it's stolen from Apex Legends. Huh. Avoid.
* These categories are really dominated by a limited set of people
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/scifihuman01-39614
  * Something slightly arresting about this guy?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/sci-fi-vr-hand-2-0-188394
  * Oooohhhh VR hands that's interesting!
  * I wonder how big they are?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/cyborg-kamikaze-53637
  * He looks too hot, could be funny

Leaning toward the scifi human and the hands here.

### 3D > Characters > Robots

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Frobots&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/sci-fi-multi-purpose-robot-129301
  * A multipurpose robot? It's the Recommended
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/low-poly-scifi-turrets-107425#content
  * I like the idea of the staging this has though the things themselves are pretty unintersting
  * The imagery on the asset story already presents it like it's in a gallery..
* Marcelo Barrio is the dominant voice here
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/mech-crawler-107422
  * Kind of neat?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/brute-robot-173508
  * Pretty nice robot... Marcelo again

Tricky. Perhaps taking a rist on the turrets and their staging as well as a Barrio (like the Brute Robot)?

### 3D > Environments

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments&price=4-4&orderBy=1&rows=96

Oh boy. This is a tough one because there are 950 in the category, but 637 are accounted for in the subcategories. That said, I should be able to spot novelty?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/traps-and-obstacles-pack-195360
  * This is cute and really speaks to ideas in design
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/arc-ai37-007-126328
  * Oh fuck yeah this is that apartment with crazy-ass photorealism..

  * Love the thought of a gym in the desert... sweating it out...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/bblock-61644
  * Actually something this is a really nice idea because it's a behind the curtain kind of thing... pregame asset...
  * Other prototyping assets
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/proprototype-collection-46952
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/beach-shack-with-props-94510
  * Very pretty...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/pack-of-two-low-pbr-poly-game-ready-garages-warehouse-169589
  * Oh I like these a lot, very art world. Just a couple of garages.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/desert-city-pack-104804#content
  * A desert city is interesting in a desert?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/small-town-america-super-store-57064
  * An entire superstore. Fuuuuuuck...
  * Another great interior...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/parking-environment-97785
  * A parking environment. Fuck me.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/post-apocalyptic-gas-station-environment-189984
  * Lovely exterior...

  * Unbelievable stuff
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/air-conditioner-props-models-for-enviroment-188903
  * Ah I really wanted this one but it's in so much competitin...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/bus-stop-soviet-rusty-102044
  * Hard not to like a Soviet bus stop...

WELL SHIT. There are just far, far too many beautiful options in this collection. And an interior or a structure with an interior? Tops are

* Prototype: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/bblock-61644
* Building: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/small-town-america-super-store-57064
* Interior: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial-sawmill-modular-pack-175703#content
* Interior: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/old-vintage-office-190597

SHIT. Oh well, it's these two

* ~~Prototype: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/bblock-61644)~~
* ~~Building: (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/small-town-america-super-store-57064)~~

### 3D > Environments > Dungeons

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Fdungeons&price=4-4&orderBy=1

This is an area where I worry a touch about things that are too big? But hopefully not?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/medieval-dungeon-torture-chamber-131181
  * A pretty impressiv dungeon. I'm SUPER curious about the issue of getting in and out of a space like this though?
* The environmental stuff is one of those moments where we kind of get to Kabokov style things though right?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/medieval-treasure-113695
  * Glinty sparkly treasure...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/mine-92461
  * Interesting how manyu of these are modular of course
  * Both takes away from the inherent artistry but is so lovely and practical
  * This is pretty neat
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/new-dungeon-pack-modular-low-poly-174175
  * Low poly is always fun and worth having?
* I guess for this category having two actual dungeons makes an amount of sense
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/dungeon-3d-starter-162930#content
  * Something pleasingly amateurish here?

This will be hard to choose. I think two dungeons/spaces is the way to go but now I wonder about space in a broader sense actually. I wonder if I can expand my desert?

### 3D> Environments > Fantasy

* This is where my Maksim comes from, so I'd still pick two and forget the statues I think
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-church-69453
  * Nice church though you can't go in... I like the intermediate resolution
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-windmill-69647
  * I do like a windmill
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-ruins-pack-12207
  * Obviously. Yes. We need some ruins and here they are.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/medieval-houses-watermill-and-props-pack-123866
  * Something interesting here with the mechanism of the watermill
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/titan-town-47104
  * ENORMOUS. Kind of wonder if it's conceivable to transport to my desert
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/hq-medieval-forge-150002
  * YEAH this is pretty nice...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-town-mobile-19792
  * Something interesting about mobile-ready
  * Also more designed for far off camera so interesting to look at them at large scale in FPS...

Hmmm there's some good stuff here really. Leaning to Fantasy Ruins Pack and Medieval Forge I think.

### 3D > Environments > Historic

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Fhistoric&price=4-4&orderBy=1

  * This is Lucisoft though who made other things I'm considering
  * Lovely potential though and classic desert material
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/ruined-desert-environment-120275
  * Interestingly appropriate, possibly should lean this way for some assets?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/old-farmhouse-34831
  * Quitebeautiful...

Quite a lot of options here, tough competition. The Pyramid, the Wharf, the Western City, the Desert Ruins

### 3D > Environments > Industrial

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Findustrial&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/hydropower-station-1929
  * Recommended
  * Seems like it would be fucking huuuuuge?
  * Started to ask the question of whether some assets would/should be displayed INSIDE other assets? But I think not?
  * Broadens out ideas for other projects though...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/apocalypse-pack-58281
  * Oh Maksim, you know me too well. An apocalypse pack.
  * Don't think this is the best use of his one asset for me though.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/trailer-house-165578
  * Really nice trailer... shame you can't go in though.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/abandoned-church-147858
  * Claims to have an interior which is intriguing
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/industrial-warehouse-building-167860
  * Quite appealingly banal
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/station-v1-103418
  * Oh I LIKE this one...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/hermetic-door-121876
  * This is poetic for sure...

Some great options in here. Station v1 for sure. Trailer is neat and so is the church and the warehouse... good options here. Hermetic door too. Hmm.

### 3D > Environments > Landscapes

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Flandscapes&price=4-4&orderBy=1

This is maybe where I run into trouble if they're all/mostly terrains? There can only be one?

* So I already have Sahara Desert Landscape, meaning I only need one other.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Flandscapes&price=4-4&orderBy=1
  * So Skyboxes are another interesting one though I can't quite get excited about it...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/cavern-entrances-18283
  * Quite like these cavern entrances
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/realistic-stones-and-ground-texture-65301
  * Stones. I like the idea of buying some stones.

  * I do like an apocalypse
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-landscapes-campsite-124422
  * This campsite is super charming, this maaaay be the winner?

### 3D > Props > Clothing > Accessories

  * Funny how they can evoke stuff like a graduation
  * Many hat packs include a headdress which is pretty offensive potentially
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/cavalier-hat-87705
  * That's a pretty expensive single hat

I'm leaning rings and bandanas, but I kind of want the storytelling power of hats...

### 3D > Props > Clothing > Armor

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fprops%2Fclothing%2Farmor&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/armor/slavic-shields-159411
  * Nice shield, yep
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/armor/ultimate-hat-knight-133217
  * Solid knight helmet "hat"

By the way there's a small problem with the curatorial strategy of the categories which is all the higher level categories can have things in them that AREN'T in a sub category.

In this case most obviously "Clothing" has a lot more in it than the things represented in Accessories and Armor. It'd be slightly harder to do, but I could also include pieces from categories higher up.

The problem being where does that end? Taken to the extreme it would mean... 44 categories to cover (ever individual category and subcategory), which would be 88 assets (if I were doing two per category still like Noah's ark which I do like) which would cost... US$439 or CAD$540. Which... well it's fine, it's not THAT much money but it's more than I was planning on? But also who fucking cares? But also can I FIT 88 things? Probably right? Or I can make it work right?

Yeah okay I'm sold. Well I'll go an backfill the things that need back filling then I suppose. Don't want to miss genius or otherwise fascinating objects/environments just because the person who made them didn't chuck them in the right place. Though it'll be really hard to find things sometimes that AREN'T in a sub category? There's no negation option that I know of.

Hmmm... these are hard to the extent I'd like to avoid things that are obvious categorizable in sub cats... but I guess that's hard to avoid.

I'd go Pot Plants and Grass maybe?

Tempted by the last two I guess?


## Curatorial heuristics

My plan here is to develop a set of rationales for why one work and not another.

### Variety

* I think my baseline decision making should be around displaying a variety of assets at the price point so we can get a sense of the range, this will presumably invite the most questions from a player (and myself) and that's at the centre of this
* What kinds of categories are there that we can vary?
  * Resolution
  * Realism
  * Skill in execution
  * Size
  * Interactivity/activity
  * Genre connotations
  * Art style (cartoonish, low poly, realism, contemporary, etc.)
  * Quantity of elements (a single car, a collection of cars, a city, a room)
  * Genre of element (object, character, room, terrain, something else...)
  * Animation
  * Natural, fabricated
* There are a lot.

## Exhibition logistics

My plan here is to develop thoughts about how to position things in the space and why.

* Flatness. One issue is that some objects kind of require a flat space to actually work on. If you have a city street grid, say, you can't just embed the whole thing deep into sand dunes and still feel like you're doing is credit? So do I create cubic-platforms that support something like that and allow it to live its best life?
* Rooms. For interiors it may be necessary to build walls to enclose them depending on how they're implemented? I really loved my internal vision, at least, of walking into a kind of simple bunker and ending up in some beautiful room.
* Lighting. Various things look like they have their own lighting settings and preferences (and even rendering pipelines). I can imagine trouble on that front.

### Didacts

What shall they have on them?

* Name of the work
* Author of the work
* Category of the work (Is this like a medium? e.g. 3D > Environments > Landscapes)
* Price of the work ($4.99, duh)
* Purchase date/time of the work
* **Maybe** some kind of further information?
* **Ideally** some link to the official asset page

# Installation notes

## 27-05-2021 15:03

* Dunes of the Sahara are not great for positioning largely flat objects
* Had to use a cube stand for the biological cells, but it did turn out well at least
* Can lay things out along the bottoms of dunes where it's almost flat, but that would help at all for a large object
* Possible that Sahara is a bad landscape for this, shit
* Lighting fucking sucks okay? Serious issue potential around the ways in which the producers of (perhaps mostly the larger?) assets assume the lighting will be handled - e.g. baked/non, relationship to GI, lighting systems embedded in the model, and so on
* Having partially installed the SuperStore I can at least say it's not a complete disaster? It also raised some interesting questions around things like colliders: the SuperStore doesn't come with them. Initially I'd assumed I would add them because... well because I wanted the store to be "real" in the space, but that's not actually showing you the asset as it is, and in fact the fact it doesn't have colliders is kind of interesting as an experience of the insubstantiality of things? So I put it on a plinth (a big one!) and this means you can walk level with the floor, but that's it. I should probably make some stairs in ProBuilder for the access points. Or rather ramps to be accessible!
* SuperStore has stuff on the top, do I need a viewing platform?! Wow. That's an interesting one.

* Started install of BBlock yesterday (position) and finished it today (rotation and grounding). Epic process of looking at and moving every single one of around 680 individual pieces, some of which have really awkward shapes (I'm looking at you skinny shallow ramps!). The end result is honestly quite beautiful though
* Raises the question of informational plinth because it's such a large area - I've put one on each of the four "side", but it does still feel a bit like someone might not find them?
* been thinking, too, about map making and read some good ideas online about a special UI layer and associating symbols (UIImage) with that layer and then a sky camera that looks down on them. Should work well. Also still wondering about whether to "tick off" things as you view them, or just let the player/audience remember (probably that one). Wondering about the available resolution on the map and whether it'll display alright if I want to have dots for position and then also at least the title of each work? 88 things is a lot of things...

## 02-06-2021 14:12

* Added roadside marquee. Kind of disappointed to find that the prefabs don't actually have prewritten text on them, and I don't think it's probably fair to use the sample scenes to take them from? Or is it? Not really? Or IS it? HMMMMMMMMMM. This is an interesting question because with a scene the develop is explicitly trying to show off how cool their asset is, so that's a plus. On the other hand it adds a lot of potential contextual extras... gee I don't actually know what to do with that.
* In the end I did use the demo versions from the scene for installation - I think it's a more accurate vision of what the developer thinks about the asset, and I think that's okay.
* Installed low poly campsite. Ran into the issue of its demo scene using an asset for positioning I don't have so had to disable that (feels very much little a dirty little curatorial/installer secret moment). Other than that it works well. Well except the block it's on is super high, so I had to probuild some stairs up to it, but I like that! It's quite beautiful in the end and very chill compared to the desert all around it!
* While installing the ZOMBIE MoCap asset I ran into the fact that their demo animation controller only included four animations in a cycle which doesn't show off everything the thing can do, so I went in and added every single animation in a cycle. BUT it turns out that as far as I can tell this causes the character to move a bit through the cycle so it won't stay aligned... notably it won't stay with its plinth over time... need some way to correct for that. FIXED: disable Apply Root Motion
* Added Personality Animations Kit which is wonderfully blunt and also suggests "typical personalities" like "Sneak" and "Waiter". Oh god that's good. The animation names are so good I had to add a specific "from left to right" part to the label to explain what each one is because I don't want the viewer to miss out. It's a case of me explicitly commenting a bit which I don't know if I love, but it's too too beautiful.
